The Lost Kitten

One sunny afternoon, Mia was playing in her backyard when she heard a tiny "meow." She looked under the bushes and saw a small, gray kitten with white paws. The kitten looked scared and hungry.

Mia’s Decision
Mia gently picked up the kitten and asked her mom, "Can we keep it?" Mom smiled and said, "First, we need to check if it belongs to someone." They made posters with the kitten’s picture and their phone number.

The Search
For two days, no one called. Mia named the kitten "Socks" because of its white paws. She gave Socks a cozy bed, a bowl of milk, and a red ball to play with.

A Happy Surprise
On the third day, old Mr. Jenkins from down the street called. He said, "That’s my cat, Whiskers!" When Mia brought Socks—now Whiskers—to Mr. Jenkins, he explained that Whiskers had slipped out when the door was open.

A New Friendship
Mr. Jenkins thanked Mia for taking care of Whiskers. He even invited her to visit anytime. Mia was sad but happy Whiskers was home. The next week, Mom surprised Mia with a new kitten from the animal shelter!
